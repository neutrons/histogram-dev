** create slicers **

It seems useful to have a histogram slicer that can create slice of
a histogram.
It can be used when only a part of the data is interesting and it 
would be unecessary to reduce the whole data set which could take forever.

Slicers now include:

VectorSlicer: create a slice of a vector
StdvectorDatasetSlicer: create a slice of a dataset
AxisSlicer: create a slice of an axis
HistogramSlicer: create a slice of a histogram

The general interface for a slicer class is:

  - constructor: ctor( instance_to_be_sliced )
  - get a slice: getSlice( slice_or_list_of_slices )

Please take a look at unit tests to see how slicers are used.
