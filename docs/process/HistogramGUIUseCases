= Histogram GUI Use Cases =

 * load histogram from file
 * View 1-D histogram
 * View 2-D histogram
 * Customize plot
   * change title
   * change axis labels
 * Save image to a file
 * make slices of histograms

== More details about customization of plots ==

(revised from Olivier's comments in ticket #130)

===  Plot Raw data I(phi, pixel, tof) ===

 1. image plot of I(phi, tof) in false colors:
   * choose orientation of plot I or I{transpose}
   * choose range for axes
   * (choose tick marks spacing / add minor tick marks)
   * label axes
   * title
   * *add colorbar*
   * choose range of color coding (ie: clim(min, max))
   * choose color palette (different color palettes render the faint details better than others)
   * choice of plotting intensity I or Sqrt(I) or Ln(I) (if no zeroes)
 1. simple X-Y plot of I(tof):
   * choose the Y-range with zooming option (for example as implemented in PharosPlotI_tof.py) since the background is much smaller than elastic peak
   * change the X-range


=== Reduced data ===

 1. image plots for S(Q,E), S(phi, E):
   * all of the above for image plot of raw data
 1. Add:
   * plot of S(Q) for E around the elastic line (diffraction pattern), requires choice of energy range around zero.
   * plot of S(E)
   * for both S(E), S(Q), choose the Y-range
   * especially for S(E), add error bars on plot *this is very useful to estimate wether statistics are good enough during experiment*
