Introduction
============

The histogram `python <http://python.org>`_ package
provides a simple yet fundamental
data structure for scientific computing: histogram.
A histogram object is a container of axes, data, and error bars.
With this package, you can create histograms, take slices of them,
and perform numerical operations.

.. The datasets in a histogram can be easily retrieved as
.. `numpy <http://numpy.org/>`_ arrays.
.. The meta data of a histogram are
.. accessible through member functions
.. of the histogram and the associated data objects.

Here is an example of a python session::

    from histogram import histogram, axis, arange, plot
    xaxis = axis('x', arange(5), unit='meter')
    yaxis = axis('y', arange(7), unit='cm')
    axes = [xaxis, yaxis]
    h = histogram( "intensity", axes, fromfunction=lambda x,y: x**2+y**2)
    print h
    plot(h)
    help(h)
    slice = h[3, ()]
    from histogram.hdf import dump
    dump(slice, 'slice.h5')

.. For more details about how to manipulate histograms,
.. please read :ref:`python-interface` .
.. Histograms can also be accessed
.. from within the Histogram GUI application,
.. which may be more convenient and interactive.
.. The :ref:`gui` has more details about that.
