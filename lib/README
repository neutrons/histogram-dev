c++ library for histogram-related stuff
This library depends on pyre journal.
The distributed histogram python package does not need
to contain this c++ library.

A histogram is thought to be data defined on grid, or griddata.

A griddata represents a mapping:
  lambda: x,y,... --> f

A griddata is decomposed to axis mappers and a multidimensional array.
An axis mapper maps a value (of x, or y, or ...) to index.
The multidimensional array maps the indexes to a value of f.

The data objects underlying GridData data objects are:

 - AxisMapper
 - NdArray


AxisMapper is an abstract base class. EvenlySpacedAxisMapper is a useful implementation.

NdArray is a template for multidimensional array that takes a 1D array
and view it as a nD array.

Array_1D can be seen as a special case of NdArray.

The most-commonly-used GridData objects are EvenlySpacedGridData objects.
For EvenlySpacedGridData, Axes are evenly spaced.
They can be used to represent
I(tof)
I(detID, pixelID, tof)
I(Q,E)
etc etc.
